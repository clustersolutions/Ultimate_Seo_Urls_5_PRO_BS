Creating a module using the template Usu_Template.php should be very simple.

Throughout the file you will find xxx or XXX or Xxx, these are the only parts that need changing. There are 13 but most are the same.

I'll detail them below: -

class Xxx_Page_Module extends aPage_Modules {

Might become ..


class My_Contribname_Page_Module extends aPage_Modules {

You will find 7 of these .. xxx_id.

These should all be the same value and represent the querystring key like cPath or products_id.

So lets say your contribution uses contrib_id, you would change all instances of xxx_id to contrib_id

Next see 'marker'     => '-xxx-'

This relates to the marker you are using for seo urls e.g.

products_id = -p-
cPath = -c-

So let's say your contribution has chosen -y- ( it should be one character only and must not have been already used )

you change the code to ..

'marker'     => '-y-'

Now let's look at the query template ( if your query needs are more complex you will have to make the necessary mods yourself ) ..

'query'      => "SELECT xxx FROM :TABLE_XXX WHERE contrib_id=':contrib_id' AND language_id=':languages_id' LIMIT 1",

We have already changed the xxx_id so we now need to change the TABLE_XXX

TABLE_XXX is the define for the table your contribution is accessing to retrieve the link text.

e.g. for a products page the define would be TABLE_PRODUCTS_DESCRIPTION

Let's say yours is TABLE_MY_CONTRIBUTION

The table code should therefore be changed to ..

'query'      => "SELECT xxx FROM :TABLE_MY_CONTRIBUTION WHERE contrib_id=':contrib_id' AND language_id=':languages_id' LIMIT 1",

We are still left with one xxx in there and I can't guess that one it is the name of the field we are retrieving from the table TABLE_MY_CONTRIBUTION.

Now we know the table define we can change the rest of the TABLE_XXX of which there are two more.

That's it!! you should now have a working page module.
